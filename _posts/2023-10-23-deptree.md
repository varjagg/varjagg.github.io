[Deptree](https://github.com/varjagg/deptree) is a tool to list and archive dependency snapshots of (ASDF-defined) projects. We at Norphonic use it in the product build pipeline, but it can be useful for integration workflows as well. The task sounds commonon enough so doubt am reinventing the wheel with this. Alas, I couldn't find any readily available solutions, so there.

Available in the latest Quicklisp.
