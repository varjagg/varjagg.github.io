[Deptree](https://github.com/varjagg/deptree) is a tool to list and archive dependency snapshots of (ASDF-defined) projects. We at Norphonic use it in the product build pipeline, but it can be useful for integration workflows as well. The task sounds common enough so there's little doubt am reinventing the wheel with this. Alas, I couldn't find any readily available solutions nor good folks at #commonlisp could recall of any, so there.

Available in the latest Quicklisp.
