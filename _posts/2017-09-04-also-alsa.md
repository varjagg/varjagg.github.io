After having some issues with microphone input handling in `portaudio` I took a shortcut and sketched [Also ALSA](https://github.com/varjagg/also-alsa): an interface to Advanced Linux Sound Architecture library. As the name suggests, it's not the first CL wrapping of it. It is however small, reasonably self-contained and can handle both input and output.

LGPL to comply with `alsa-lib`.
