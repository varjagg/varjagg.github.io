When I wrote about EURISKO a few years [before](/lisp/2018/11/03/am-eurisko-lenat-documents/) there hardly was an expectation of a follow-up. The system was a dusty legend with some cynical minds arguing whether it existed in the first place.

However, Lenat's death in August last year has unlocked his [SAILDART archives](https://www.saildart.org/[*,DBL]/) account. This has led to a [thrilling discovery](https://white-flame.com/am-eurisko.html) of both AM and EURISKO sources by *WhiteFlame*. In a further development, *seveno4* has managed to [adapt EURISKO to run](https://github.com/seveno4/EURISKO) on Medley Interlisp.

While I marveled at the idea of discovery systems before I hadn't even considered ever running EURISKO myself as a possibility. Truly an Indiana Jones finding the Lost Ark moment. Yet this very low probability event has indeed happened, as documented in the video below.
