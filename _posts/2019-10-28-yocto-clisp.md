title: Yocto recipe for CLISP
category: Lisp
---

Some time ago I put together a simple [recipe for building CLISP](https://github.com/varjagg/recipes-lisp) with [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org). It is pinned to 2.49.93 and should work both for target and -native builds. Tested with Sumo only.
